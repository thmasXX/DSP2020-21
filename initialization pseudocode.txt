CALCULATE size of each particle
IF particleSize > capacity of knapsacks:
	RANDOM replace 1,0's to find solution
CALCULATE fitness of particle
INITIALIZE random velocity between -2.0 and 2.0
INITIALIZE random position between 0.0 and 4.0
INITIALIZE pBest as current particle data
CALCULATE gBest
