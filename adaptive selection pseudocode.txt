#Question: should I just let the selections run through? and not check for capacity and just
classify it as a non-solution if it dont meet the constraints and let it run again and just
-1 for all the credit counts that were iterated up one?

CHECK IF ANY MUTATED DATA MEETS CAPACITY.
IF ANY MEET CAPACITY:
	CHECK WHICH MEET CAPACITY
	COMPARE CREDITS BETWEEN ONES THAT MEET CAPACITY
	CHOOSE MUTATION WITH MOST CREDITS AS DATA TO BE PROGRESSED.
	CREDIT THAT MUTATION
	
	IF CREDITS BETWEEN BOTH ARE EQUAL
		RANDOM SELECT ONE OF MUTATIONS
		CREDIT THAT MUTATION.
